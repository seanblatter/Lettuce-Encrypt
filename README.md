Lettuce Encrypt Seed Generator ðŸŒ±

Lettuce Encrypt Seed Generator is a true seed generator using Python and entropy from camera feed. 

Simply hit Play or Run in your IDE to generate your random number. 

You will be prompted to provide an RTSP URL (rtsp://...), a video file path, or leave empty to use the default webcam (0).
After capturing frames for entropy, your random seed will be produced. Simple, fun, and easy to use!

Happy Planting!

Gratefully,
Sean Blatter
